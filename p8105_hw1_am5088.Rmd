The following problems are for HW1

# Problem 1
## Importing the dataset

Here's a **code chunk** that loads the 
a _penguins_ dataset:

```{r setup}
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")

```
##Take a look at the data
```{r, include=FALSE}
tail(penguins)
```

```{r, message=FALSE}
skimr::skim(penguins)
```



## Dataset Description
The data in this dataset include 344 observations (rows) and 8 variables (columns) including the species (Adelie, Gentoo, Chinstrap), island (Torgersen, Biscoe, Dream), bill length (in mm), bill depth (in mm), flipper length (in mm), body mass (in g), sex, and year of penguins.

The mean flipper length is 201 mm. 

# Data Visualization

## Scatterplot
this code chunk creates a data frame and generates a plot
```{r scatterplot, echo=TRUE}}
 ggplot2(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point()

```

#Problem 2
this code chunk creates a data frame comprised of the following:
*a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
*a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0
*a character vector of length 10
*a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”

```{r}
problem2_df = tibble(
  vec_numeric = 1 : 10,
  vec_char = c("maximizing"),
  vec_logic = 
)

```

I can take the mean of the sample, too!
